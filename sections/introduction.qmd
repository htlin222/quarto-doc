# Introduction

This Quarto document cites the reference by @smith2023 to confirm that the bibliography is wired correctly. The helper script is handy even for small projects because it verifies that text citations such as [@lee2022] or grouped citations like [@smith2023; @chen2021] resolve before you render. You can also mention datasets inline, for example @garcia2020, and the bibliography will expand automatically.
