# Introduction

## Establishing Territory

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) now affects an estimated 537 million adults worldwide and remains a leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic lower-limb amputation, imposing substantial personal and societal burdens [@smith2023]. Metformin continues to be the recommended first-line pharmacotherapy, yet real-world registries indicate that up to one-third of patients discontinue the drug because of intolerance, leaving a large subgroup without effective control [@lee2022]. Prior trials have demonstrated that intensifying therapy can reduce HbA1c by 1–2%, but durable options for metformin-intolerant patients are limited [@smith2023].

## Establishing a Niche

However, the available evidence base has notable constraints: most randomized trials have lasted fewer than 12 months, frequently excluded patients with comorbid chronic kidney disease, and seldom examined Asian populations with distinct metabolic characteristics [@chen2021]. Nevertheless, clinicians still face daily decisions for metformin-intolerant patients, and the absence of data comparing Drug A with placebo under modern standards leaves a critical knowledge gap. Despite iterative guideline updates, the optimal strategy for patients who cannot tolerate metformin remains unclear, particularly regarding balancing glycemic efficacy with tolerability.

## Occupying the Niche

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Drug A compared with placebo among metformin-intolerant Asian adults with T2DM. We hypothesized that Drug A would lower HbA1c by at least 0.5% more than placebo over 12 weeks, while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. By addressing the unmet needs of this difficult-to-treat population, the study seeks to provide clinicians with evidence to guide individualized therapy and inform future guideline recommendations.
