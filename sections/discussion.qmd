# Discussion

## Summary of Main Findings
- Reiterate the key efficacy result (e.g., Drug A lowered HbA1c by X% more than placebo) and tolerability observations in 1 paragraph.
- Emphasize clinical meaningfulness (tie to complication risk reduction) and subgroup consistency.

## Comparison with Existing Literature
- Compare with concordant trials (e.g., cite [@smith2023], [@lee2022]) and describe similar effect sizes/safety outcomes.
- Address discordant findings (e.g., higher hypoglycemia rates reported elsewhere such as [@chen2021]) and propose reasons (population, duration, co-therapies).

## Mechanistic Interpretation
- Explain plausible physiological pathways (e.g., appetite regulation, incretin modulation) using hedging language.
- Cite supportive evidence or datasets (e.g., [@garcia2020]) that reinforce behavioral or digital components.

## Limitations
- Begin with "This study has several limitations" and then list at least four constraints (sample size, follow-up duration, single ethnicity/center, adherence measurement, missing-data assumptions) with their potential impact.

## Clinical Implications and Future Research
- Discuss how findings could inform clinical practice or guidelines, including monitoring recommendations.
- Outline future trials (longer follow-up, head-to-head comparisons, special populations, dosing optimization).

## Conclusion
- Provide a concise closing statement summarizing efficacy, safety, and the overarching message for clinicians.
