# Methods

## Study Design
- Specify the overall design (e.g., randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled) and provide a one-sentence research overview.
- Report total sample size, study duration, setting, and registry/IRB identifiers.
- Confirm ethical approvals and adherence to international guidelines.

## Participants
- Detail inclusion criteria (age range, confirmed T2DM, HbA1c thresholds, metformin intolerance, renal function, etc.).
- List exclusion criteria (pregnancy, severe organ dysfunction, recent cardiovascular events, prior DKA, concurrent trials).
- Describe recruitment setting, screening workflow, and informed consent procedures.
- Explain randomization ratio, sequence generation, allocation concealment, and any stratification factors.

## Interventions
- Define experimental and control regimens: dosage, route, frequency, timing, packaging, blinding measures, and adherence support.
- Indicate treatment duration, visit schedule, rescue therapy triggers, and concomitant-care policies.
- Note blinding schema (e.g., double-blind) and accountability procedures.

## Outcome Measures
- State the primary endpoint (e.g., HbA1c change from baseline to week 12) and analytical method (HPLC vs lab-specific assay).
- Enumerate secondary endpoints (fasting plasma glucose, body weight, blood pressure, responder rates, patient-reported outcomes, safety events).
- Provide measurement time points, data-collection tools, and definitions of hypoglycemia/adverse events.

## Statistical Analysis
- Describe sample-size calculation inputs (effect size, SD, α, power, anticipated attrition) and resulting target enrollment.
- Identify software (e.g., R 4.3.1, SAS 9.4), summary statistics (mean +/- SD, n [%]), and modeling approaches (ANCOVA, mixed-effects models, logistic regression).
- Define significance thresholds, multiplicity controls, and sensitivity analyses.
- Explain missing-data handling (intention-to-treat, last observation carried forward, multiple imputation) and any subgroup analyses.
