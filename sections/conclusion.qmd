Drug A lowered HbA1c, fasting glucose, body weight, and blood pressure more than placebo while preserving an acceptable safety profile in metformin-intolerant Asian adults with type 2 diabetes. Embedding citation validation and modular authoring into the workflow ensures that subsequent manuscript iterations remain reproducible and ready for dissemination across Quarto outputs.
