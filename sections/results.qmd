## Participant Flow

A total of 200 individuals were screened, of whom 30 failed to meet inclusion criteria and 20 declined participation (Figure 1). The remaining 150 participants were randomized equally to Drug A (n = 75) or placebo (n = 75). Overall, 142 participants (94.7%) completed the 12-week intervention; five participants (three Drug A, two placebo) were lost to follow-up, and three (two Drug A, one placebo) withdrew consent before the week-12 visit. All randomized participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

## Baseline Characteristics

Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups (Table 1). Mean age was 55.2 ± 8.3 years in the Drug A group and 54.8 ± 7.9 years in the placebo group (p = 0.72), and 48% versus 52% were men (p = 0.65). Body mass index averaged 28.5 ± 3.2 versus 28.1 ± 3.5 kg/m² (p = 0.58), baseline HbA1c was 8.2 ± 0.9% versus 8.3 ± 0.8% (p = 0.76), and diabetes duration was 6.5 ± 3.2 versus 6.8 ± 3.5 years (p = 0.69). Blood pressure, lipid profiles, and concomitant therapies also showed no significant group differences.

## Primary Outcome

Drug A produced a greater HbA1c reduction from baseline to week 12 than placebo (−1.2 ± 0.5% vs −0.3 ± 0.4%). The adjusted between-group difference was −0.9% (95% CI, −1.1 to −0.7; p < 0.001), corresponding to a Cohen's d of 1.8. Seventy-two percent of Drug A recipients achieved HbA1c <7.0% compared with 28% of placebo recipients (p < 0.001).

## Secondary Outcomes

Drug A led to greater improvements in FPG (−32 ± 15 vs −8 ± 14 mg/dL; p < 0.001), body weight (−2.1 ± 1.4 vs −0.5 ± 1.2 kg; p < 0.001), and systolic blood pressure (−4.6 ± 6.8 vs −1.2 ± 7.0 mm Hg; p = 0.02). Diastolic blood pressure decreased modestly in both arms (−2.1 ± 5.9 vs −0.8 ± 6.1 mm Hg; p = 0.18). Patient-reported gastrointestinal discomfort scores improved similarly between groups (p = 0.64). These outcomes are summarized in Table 2.

## Adverse Events

Hypoglycemia occurred in 12% (9/75) of Drug A recipients and 4% (3/75) of placebo recipients (p = 0.03). Gastrointestinal discomfort was reported by 8% (6/75) versus 5% (4/75) (p = 0.52). No serious adverse events or deaths occurred in either group. All hypoglycemic episodes were mild, resolved with oral carbohydrate intake, and did not require hospitalization.
