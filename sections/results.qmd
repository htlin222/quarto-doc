# Results

## Participant Flow
- Document total individuals screened, excluded (with reasons), randomized, and analyzed; reference a CONSORT-style Figure.
- Provide counts for completed participants, withdrawals, and losses to follow-up separated by study arm.

## Baseline Characteristics
- Summarize Table 1 findings (age, sex, BMI, HbA1c, diabetes duration, additional variables) with mean ± SD or n (%).
- Report p values demonstrating comparability between groups.

## Primary Outcome
- Present the primary endpoint (e.g., HbA1c change) for each arm (mean ± SD) along with adjusted between-group difference, 95% CI, p value, and effect size (e.g., Cohen's d).
- Mention responder proportions (e.g., HbA1c <7%) if prespecified.

## Secondary Outcomes
- Enumerate each secondary endpoint (fasting glucose, weight, BP, patient-reported symptoms, responder rates) with arm-specific values and statistical tests/p values.
- Reference Table 2 or Figures as appropriate.

## Adverse Events
- Provide incidence of each adverse event (e.g., hypoglycemia, GI discomfort) in both arms with counts, percentages, and p values.
- Note serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and overall safety interpretation.
