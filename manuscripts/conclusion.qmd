# Conclusion

- Write a final paragraph distilling the primary efficacy and safety takeaways (e.g., "Drug A lowered HbA1c, fasting glucose, body weight, and blood pressure compared with placebo while maintaining an acceptable safety profile in metformin-intolerant Asian adults with type 2 diabetes").
- Mention reproducibility benefits (e.g., modular authoring, citation validation) if relevant to the manuscript narrative.

## Proposed Titles
- Provide five title options that each include the intervention, comparator, primary outcome, target population, and study design. Examples of acceptable formats:
  1. `[Intervention] for [Outcome] in [Population]: Randomized Controlled Trial`
  2. `Effect of [Intervention] on [Outcome] in [Population]`
  3. `[Intervention] versus [Comparator] for [Outcome]: [Study Design]`
- Keep each title within 10–15 words, avoid abbreviations, and make sure the design type (e.g., randomized trial) is explicit.
