# Introduction

## Establishing Territory
- Summarize the public health burden of type 2 diabetes (e.g., global prevalence ≈537 million adults) and its major complications such as blindness, kidney failure, and amputations.
- Highlight current standards of care (metformin first-line) and real-world limitations, citing key sources like [@smith2023] or [@lee2022].
- Emphasize why metformin-intolerant patients represent a clinically important subgroup.

## Establishing a Niche
- Use contrast language (e.g., "However" or "Despite this") to describe gaps in existing trials (short duration, exclusion of renal impairment, scarcity of Asian cohorts) with supporting literature such as [@chen2021].
- State the unresolved clinical question (e.g., lack of Drug A vs placebo data for metformin-intolerant patients).
- Clarify why this knowledge gap limits guideline development and day-to-day care.

## Occupying the Niche
- Introduce the study aim with a sentence like "The aim of this study was to..." covering population, intervention, comparator, and timeframe.
- Mention any prespecified hypothesis (e.g., Drug A would lower HbA1c ≥0.5% more than placebo) and anticipated safety profile.
- Close with the anticipated significance for clinicians, policy makers, or future research communities, optionally referencing digital workflow advantages described in [@garcia2020].
