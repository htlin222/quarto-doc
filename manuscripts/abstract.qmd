# Abstract

**Background:** 2–3 sentences summarizing the disease burden (e.g., T2DM prevalence, metformin intolerance) and knowledge gap that motivates this study.

**Objective:** One sentence stating the purpose (e.g., "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Drug A versus placebo in metformin-intolerant Asian adults with type 2 diabetes").

**Methods:** 3–4 sentences describing the design (e.g., randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled), sample size, intervention doses, control strategy, study duration, primary endpoint (HbA1c change), secondary endpoints, and analytic approach (ANCOVA, mixed-effects models). Mention measurement time points and adherence to the intention-to-treat principle.

**Results:** 3–4 sentences inserting key quantitative findings for the primary endpoint (mean change, SD, between-group difference, 95% CI, p value, effect size), secondary endpoints (fasting glucose, weight, BP, responder rates), and safety events (hypoglycemia incidence, serious adverse events). Reference associated tables or figures if helpful.

**Conclusions:** 1–2 sentences providing the clinical implication (e.g., Drug A offers a viable alternative for metformin-intolerant patients) and broader significance.
