# Acknowledgements

We thank the clinical research coordinators and laboratory technologists at Taipei Endocrine Research Hospital for their meticulous data collection, as well as the participants for their sustained engagement. The study team also appreciates the institutional biostatistics core for monitoring data quality.

## AI Usage Disclosure

**Short form:** ChatGPT (GPT-4, OpenAI; accessed November 2025) was used to draft preliminary text for the Introduction, Discussion, and Abstract based on structured prompts provided by the authors. All AI-generated material was critically reviewed, extensively revised, and approved by the authors, who retain full responsibility for the published content.

**Detailed form:** ChatGPT (GPT-4, OpenAI; November 2025 access) was employed to improve grammar, refine phrasing, and generate initial drafts for the Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Abstract after we supplied structured prompts containing study data. The authors verified every output against original data, performed substantive edits to ensure accuracy and tone, and confirmed that no proprietary or confidential information was introduced. The tool was not used for study design, data analysis, or interpretation. Final responsibility for the integrity of the manuscript rests with the authors.

## Golden Rules for AI-Assisted Writing

1. **AI is a helper, you are the author:** Do not list AI tools as authors; critically review and revise every AI-assisted sentence, and retain full responsibility for the manuscript.
2. **Transparency is mandatory:** Disclose which AI tool was used, the purpose, and how outputs were modified, following the target journal's requirements.
3. **Core scientific work must remain human-led:** Study design, data analysis, and interpretation must be performed by the investigators; AI should assist only with language or structural edits.
4. **Avoid known risks:** Never cite AI-generated references without verification, independently confirm all clinical facts, and remain vigilant for fabricated or hallucinated details.
5. **Preserve complete records:** Keep prompts, AI responses, and subsequent edits as documentation in case reviewers or editors request clarification.
