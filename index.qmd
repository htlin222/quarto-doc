# Introduction

This Quarto document cites the reference by @smith2023 to confirm that the bibliography is wired correctly.

The helper script is handy even for small projects because it verifies that text citations such as [@lee2022] or grouped citations like [@smith2023; @chen2021] resolve before you render. You can also mention datasets inline, for example @garcia2020, and the bibliography will expand automatically.

# Workflow Demo

1. Paste text into your `.qmd` files and cite normally (e.g., `@lee2022`).
2. Run `Rscript helper.R` to ensure `references.bib` includes every cite key.
3. Render with `quarto render index.qmd` to generate HTML + DOCX outputs that list the cited sources.

# Conclusion

Rendering this file should produce an AMA-formatted citation list.
